Q.string v/s stringbuffer?
-->
String:
Immutable: Once created, its value can't be changed. Any modification (like concatenation) creates a new String object.
Performance: Slower for repeated modifications because each change creates a new object.
Thread-Safety: Safe to use across threads, but not because it's designed for concurrency, just due to its immutability.

StringBuffer:
Mutable: Can be modified without creating new objects. Methods like append() or insert() change the original object.
Performance: More efficient for repeated modifications since it doesn't create new objects.
Thread-Safety: Synchronized, meaning it's safe to use in multi-threaded environments without additional synchronization.

Q. diff. ways of creating objects  ?  
-->
1)Using Class newInstance() Method
Description: You can use the newInstance() method from Class class, which calls the default (no-argument) constructor.
Example:
java
Copy code
MyClass obj = MyClass.class.newInstance();
Use Case: This method is less common and is typically used in reflection. It's important to note that newInstance() is deprecated in Java 9+ in favor of Constructor.newInstance().

2)new keyword.
3)clone method
4)factory design pattern

Q.Q. changes in hashmap?
--->
In Java 8, HashMap introduced a significant change to handle hash collisions more efficiently. When a bucketâ€™s size exceeds a threshold (default 8), 
instead of using a linked list, the bucket is transformed into a balanced binary tree (a Red-Black tree).
Benefit: This change improves the worst-case time complexity of operations like get() and put() from O(n) to O(log n) when many keys collide.
