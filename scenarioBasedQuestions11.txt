Question 1: Describe how you would ensure that the hotel booking system is scalable to handle peak traffic times, such as holiday seasons.
Answer:
To ensure scalability, I would design the system with a microservices architecture, allowing independent scaling of different components (e.g., booking, search, payment).
Using cloud services like AWS or Azure, I would implement auto-scaling policies to dynamically adjust resources based on traffic.
Load balancing would distribute traffic evenly across servers, and a CDN (Content Delivery Network) would help deliver content quickly to users globally.

Question 2: How would you implement a notification system to send booking confirmations, reminders, and promotional offers to users?
Answer:
I would implement a notification system using a message broker (e.g., RabbitMQ) to handle asynchronous messaging.
Different types of notifications (email, SMS, in-app) would be processed by dedicated microservices
For emails, I would use an email service provider (e.g., SendGrid ,mailgun , Amazon SES).
For SMS, I would integrate with an SMS gateway (e.g., Twilio).

Question 3: How would you handle booking cancellations and refunds? What would the workflow look like?
Answer:
The cancellation and refund workflow involves the following steps:
Request Cancellation: The user requests a booking cancellation through the system.
Check Eligibility: The system checks if the booking is eligible for cancellation based on the hotel’s cancellation policy.
Process Refund: If eligible, the system initiates a refund through the payment gateway.
Update Booking Status: The booking status is updated to ‘Cancelled’ in the database.
Notify User: The user receives a notification confirming the cancellation and refund status.

Question 4: How would you handle edge cases, such as partial refunds or non-refundable bookings?
Answer:
For edge cases, the system would need to handle different cancellation policies.
For partial refunds, the system would calculate the refund amount based on the policy and process it accordingly.
For non-refundable bookings, the system would notify the user that the booking cannot be refunded and update the booking status without initiating a refund.

Question 5: How would you implement user authentication and authorization in a hotel booking system? What technologies or frameworks would you use?
Answer:
I would implement user authentication using OAuth2.0 or "JWT" (JSON Web Tokens) for secure and scalable authentication.
Spring Security, combined with JWT, can be used for implementation in a Spring Boot application.
For authorization,
I would define roles and permissions (e.g., guest, hotel manager, admin) and use role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure users have appropriate access levels.

Question 6: How would you implement dynamic pricing for hotel rooms based on factors like season, demand, and customer loyalty?
Answer:
I would implement dynamic pricing by creating a pricing engine that considers various factors such as seasonality, demand, and customer loyalty.
This engine would use predefined rules and algorithms to calculate the room price in real-time
For instance, during high-demand periods, prices can be adjusted upwards, while loyal customers can receive discounts.
The pricing data would be stored in a database and accessed by the booking system to display and apply the correct prices.
for example :- use spring drools
steps:-
i. add dependency "kie-spring"
ii. drools rule file (pricerules.drl)
iii. add drools configuration class as well
iv. controller and service.
